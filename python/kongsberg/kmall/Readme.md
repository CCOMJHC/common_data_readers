# Kongsberg "KMALL" file reader

Modern Kongsberg bathymetric sonar systems, which acquire data using "Seafloor Inforation System - Version 5" produce data files in the ".kmall" data format. This module (class) and utility reads these data formats and provides several tools for reporting information about the data within the file.

Although low-level readers for many of the datagram types is in place, little other infrastucture exists. This reader remains a work in progress. 

    ./kmall.py -h
    usage: kmall.py [-h] [-f KMALL_FILENAME] [-d KMALL_DIRECTORY] [-V] [-v]
